Two effects, one for the start of the ability, and one for the damage.

Place the sniper_grenade_launch in your particles folder.
In the npc_abilities_custom,

}

The parent effect for the start of the ability is "sniper_grenade_launch.vpcf".

The parent effect for the damaget of the ability is "sniper_grenade_launch_explosion.vpcf".
