This is the list of icons to be made due less than ideal availability of dota 2 replacement icon.
Listed icons are named by the ability/item name within wc3 snipers remix.
Icon should be based on original wc3 snipers remix icon used, except when the original icon was bad (also potentially reworking dota 2 icons if that makes things any easier?) .
Total number of icons estimated to be "probably like 50."
